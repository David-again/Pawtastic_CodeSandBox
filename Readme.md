# PawTastic!!! A simple pet-tracking site.
### A project I'm working on for a hypothetical pet-grooming agency.

Will begin with the registration page for the user's pet.
Next will be the registration page for the owner.
Finally a MongoDB database to store and link their details.

From there, the project might expand... we never know, what tomorrow holds!

At this time, it is being developed using CodeSandBox in React. 

It will start with the desktop version (which will also work on iPad screens)
This will later be metamorphosized to cater for a Mobile-first philosophy.

Come back soon! ðŸ˜Ž
